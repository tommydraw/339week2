            <p>I learnt how to cook Coca-Cola chicken wings from my mother, and I've since tweaked her recipe to better suit my family's palate, making it less sweet. While the cooking process remains straightforward, the result is incredibly flavorful, and once you've tried it, you'll understand its delicious appeal!
